# wordpress-docker

After native docker support for OSX and Win was added at beta stage, the [wordpress out of the box](https://github.com/creative-workflow/wordpress-docker) repo runs smooth =)
You will get a running wordpress instance based on the latest wordpress source, a database where the wordpress data will be stored, phpmyadmin for database management and extendible gulp tasks with livereload pre configured. And this all running inside of docker container so your dev system stays clean =)
