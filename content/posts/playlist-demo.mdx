This page shows the `Playlist` MDX component. Provide an array of tracks (title, src, optional duration) and it renders controls plus a selectable list.

<AudioPlaylist
  heading='Lo-fi ideas'
  tracks='[{"title":"Evening loop","src":"https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-1.mp3","duration":"3:21"},{"title":"Morning sketch","src":"https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-2.mp3","duration":"4:02"},{"title":"Bass theme","src":"https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-3.mp3","duration":"2:48"}]'
/>

You can swap the URLs for local files in `public/media` to ship them with the static export.
