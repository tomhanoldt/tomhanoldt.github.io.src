# easy-terminal-app

A minimal "terminal-app" with maximum comfort for me, you and all of our [bash](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Shell))-scripting friends =)
This **terminal application skeleton** is ment for replacing endless switch-case instructions in control scripts and reinventing the wheel again and again.
It is **minimal** because it only depends on standard [bash](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Shell)).
It has **maximal comfort** because:

* easily add a command by creating a simple bash script
* separated config file for your scripts
* automatic help generation (greps command-scripts for specific marks)
* logging and colored outputs ready to use
* write tests for your scripts and run with travis or similar
* simply adjust the scripts for your needs (all in all only 300 lines of app code)

### usage

```bash
Usage: ./app [command] [help|*]

Available commands:

 du                     show disk usage

 os                     helps detecting current os (exports $is_osx, $is_win, $is_linux)
```
