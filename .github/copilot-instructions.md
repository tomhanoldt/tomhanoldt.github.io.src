Guidelines
----------
- Keep communication concise and focused; follow development best practices.
- Always consult and respect the guidance in DOCS.md when working on this repo.
- Run `bun run lint:fix` after edits, then `bun run lint`; fix all issues. If lint errors originate from MDX files under `content/posts/`, pause and ask the user how to proceed and propose a fix approach when asking.
- Document relevant new behaviour or conventions in DOCS.md as you add or change features.
- When a feature does not work after the first implementation, start `bun run dev` in the background and scrape the relevant pages yourself to debug before asking.
